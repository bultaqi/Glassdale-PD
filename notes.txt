BUTTON AND EVENT LISTENER

1. See the button show up for each criminal

<button id="associates--${criminal.id}">Known Associates</button>


2. Figure out what "criminal.id" is on the button-- maybe ask some questions there

3. Look at criminal objects in the console or in Postman or in the browser to see how to get to the known_associates property

4. What differentiates each object?

5. Make an associates folder in scripts
    - AssociateList component
    - Event Listener in AssociateList component

6. Write an event listener to listen for a button click-- it should console log that we clicked a button but it shouldn't do anythign else at this point
    - The event listener should be on the body or main element because we build the buttons with JS

THE TRICKY PART

7. When you click a single criminal's known associate's button, try to get THAT criminal's object in the console
    - Maybe there's some way we can filter these criminals using a .filter() to find the specific criminal
    - If not, that's a great time to ask a question

8. Once we get that single criminal back, console.log the known associates array for the criminal you clicked on




THE NOT SO TRICKY PART


9. Once you can get the known associates in the console, we know we have access to them and we can work on printing them in a loop in AssociatesList.js

10. Decide where we want to print our associates and add a container to our HTML file

11. Build an HTML representation in AssociateList that will print each associate's name and alibi, and target the DOM container we made in step 10
